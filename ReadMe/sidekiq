issues
1)  uninitialized constant sidekiq worker
    a)added gem and created worker file in app/workers
    b) worker seems uninitialized (in rails console)
    solution: ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths did not contain worker path. For that, restart the spring

2)Signal Handling
 a) TTIN : kill -TTIN sidekiq_process -> backtraces the sidekiq threads, to check like why the particular thread is stuck or busy
 b) USR1 : kill -USR1 sidekiq_process -> stops taking the jobs , place new upcoming jobs in queues.
 c) TERM : kill -TERM sidekiq_process -> first finishes the running jobs and stops the sidekiq
 d) resume the terminated sidekiq how ? -> bundle exec sidekiq -P ~/temp/sidekiq.pid
